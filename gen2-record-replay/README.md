# Record and Replay

These tools allow you to record encoded and synced camera streams and replay them, including reconstructing the stereo depth perception.

### Recording

When running `record.py`, it will record encoded streams from all devices and will synchronize all streams across all devices on the host. Recordings will be saved in the specified folder (with `-p`, by default that folder is `recordings/`). Recordings will be saved as MJPEG (motion JPEG) files or H265, depending on the quality of the recording. You can manually use `ffmpeg` to convert these `.mjpeg` recordings to `.mp4`. If you enable depth, program will save into rosbag (`.bag`), which you can open with [RealSense Viewer](https://www.intelrealsense.com/sdk-2/#sdk2-tools):

#### Record usage
```
usage: record.py [-h] [-p PATH] [-s [STREAMS]] [-f FPS]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --display       default=False,      Display color preview
  -p, --path,         default="recordings/"       Path where to store the captured data
  -s, --save,         default=["color", "left", "right"]   Choose which streams to save
  -f, --fps,          default=30          Camera sensor FPS, applied to all cameras
  -q, --quality,      default="HIGH",     Selects the quality of the recording
  -fc,--frame_cnt     default=-1,         Number of frames to record. Record until stopped by default
```

For the `frame_cnt`, -1 means it will record streams until user terminates the program (`CTRL+C`). If you select eg. `-fc 300 --fps 30`, recording will be of 300 frames (of each stream), for a total of 10 seconds.

`quality` specifies the quality of encoded video streams. It can either be `BEST` (lossless encoding), `HIGH`, `MEDIUM` or `LOW`. More information regarding **file sizes and quality of recordings** can be [found here](encoding_quality/README.md).

By default, depthai-record will try to **save streames directly into `.mp4` containers** you have [PyAV](https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV) installed (`python3 -mpip install av`). This will allow you to watch videos with a standard video player. More [info here](../gen2-container-encoding).

### Replaying

`replay.py` is a demo script that runs Spatial MobileNet network. It will reconstruct stereo depth perception, which will allow it to calculate spatial coordinates as well.

#### Replay usage

`Replay` class (from `libraries/depthai_replay.py`) will read `depthai_recordings` (color and mono streams) and send frames back to the device to reconstruct stereo depth perception.

There are a few things you can specify when using the `Replay` class:

```pyhton
# First initialize the Replay object, passing path to the depthai_recording
replay = Replay(path)

# Resize color frames prior to sending them to the device
replay.set_resize_color((width, height))

# Keep aspect ratio when resizing the color frames. This will crop
# the color frame to the desired aspect ratio (in our case 300x300)
# It's set to True by default. Setting it to False will squish the image,
# but will preserve the full FOV
replay.keep_aspect_ratio(False)
```
#### Replay usage
```
usage: replay.py -p PATH

optional arguments:
  -p PATH, --path PATH  Path where to store the captured data
```

## Pre-requisites

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
